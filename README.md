## Jets (Starships) Projects
### Week 2 Skill Distillery Homework

This program works based off of the display menu. This menu lets you display ships and interact with them in a limited way. When you display ships, their respective pilots are displayed with them. You also can display the pilots alone, and the fastest or furthest flying Jet.

The user is also able to interact with the cargo ships and fighters. These ships have either the dogfight or smuggler interface methods that are called. Dogfight just arms the fighters as the dogfight method did not get finished, but the cargo ship's method sends them on a 'Smuggler's Run' where they have a random chance of success.


#### Topics and Technologies used
	My program uses inheritance to have multiple classes that all share the Jet traits. This allows the different jets to be put into one large "Starport". Of those jets, the Fighter and Smuggler class both implement unique interfaces which allows them different methods than the basic jet properties.

#### Lessons Learned
	I was able to utilize arrays effectively to both add and retrieve objects. I expanded upon this with the use of instance of which allowed me to inspect the arrays for objects of a single specific type. I could then cast those objects to their own type and use their implemented methods.
